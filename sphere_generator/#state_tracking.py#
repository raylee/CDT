This file is part of the sphere_generator program which generates
spheres of (as close as possible to) uniform curvature for a given
surface area by monte carlo simulation.

This module contains classes, functions, and methods which observe and
calculate properties of the sphere being generated. The primary class
is the sphere class, which is meant to be initialized and hold the
general state of the simulation.
