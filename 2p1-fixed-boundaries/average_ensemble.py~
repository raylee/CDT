# This program loads a spacetime ensemble from a file, looks at
# 2-volume as a function of proper time, produces an average, and fits
# to a function

def extract_2_volume_ensemble(filename_list):

    Reads in each *.3sx2p1 file in filename_list and produces a list
    of lists of 2-volume information as a function of proper time.

    Returns a vector. The first element contains header data, which is
    assumed to be the same for all elements of the ensemble.
