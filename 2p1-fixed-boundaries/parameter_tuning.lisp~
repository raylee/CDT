;;;; Given a k, this program will solve for a value of litL (little
;;;; lambda) in the Einstein-Hilbert action for 2+1-dimensional
;;;; CDT. This should work for other actions as well, but program will
;;;; need to be tweaked since the number of input terms in the action,
;;;; and the min and maximum values of the coupling constants (and
;;;; probabilities) may change.
