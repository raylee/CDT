UPDATING 2p1 CODE TO WORK WITH FIXED BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL 2p1 CDT CODE BY:
Rajesh Kommu

PREVIOUS 2p1-fixed-boundary CODE BY:
David Kamensky

UPDATED CODE BY:
Jonah Miller

THE APPROACH
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Kamensky's code included a bug from outdated code written by
Rajesh that Rajesh has since fixed with the addition of several data
structures that work on lower-level simplex information. I decided
that the best way to make modern 2+1 dimensional code that works with
fixed boundary conditions would be to port David's methods to Rajesh's
new code. Fortunately, since Rajesh's changes mostly effect the
lower-level information, top-level function calls behave exactly the
same. This means I can port quite a lot of David's code word for word.
