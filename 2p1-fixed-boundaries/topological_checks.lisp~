;; This program is a module meant to be used with the 2+1-dimensional
;; CDT simulations to check that topological identities are not
;; violated. A number of topological identities are defined as
;; functions, and checks are defined to determine that the identity
;; returns the correct thing (for instance to ensure that the Euler
;; characteristic of a sphere is 2).
