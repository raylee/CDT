files_in_this_folder.txt

When updated the fixed boundaries CDT code, I changed a number of
functions substantially. However, for completeness sake, I left the
old function in the code and gave it a name like
"function-name-deprecated." I have since cleaned up the code. However,
in this folder are the files that contain the messy code with the
deprecated functions in it.

Note that I missed doing this for a couple of things. Most notably,
the original output functions are lost to time. However, the originals
are the same as are in Rajesh's 2p1 code with periodic boundary
conditions. You can find them there.
