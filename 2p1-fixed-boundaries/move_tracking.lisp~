;; This program is a module meant to be used with the 2+1-dimensional
;; CDT simulations to track how many moves of a given type may be
;; attempted at each time slice.

;; Requires the following modules to be loaded first:

;; ../utilities.lisp
;; globals.lisp
;; generalized-hash-table-counting-functions.lisp
;; simplex.lisp
;; moves.lisp

;; If you want to plot what you get, you also need
;; ascii_plotting_tools.lisp
