UPDATING 2p1 CODE TO WORK WITH FIXED BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL 2p1 CDT CODE BY:
Rajesh Kommu

PREVIOUS 2p1-fixed-boundary CODE BY:
David Kamensky

UPDATED CODE BY:
Jonah Miller


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE APPROACH
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Kamensky's code included a bug from outdated code written by
Rajesh that Rajesh has since fixed with the addition of several data
structures that work on lower-level simplex information. I decided
that the best way to make modern 2+1 dimensional code that works with
fixed boundary conditions would be to port David's methods to Rajesh's
new code. Fortunately, since Rajesh's changes mostly affect the
lower-level function calls, top-level function calls behave exactly the
same. This means I can port quite a lot of David's code word for word. 

I also need to fix some slightly incorrect physics in David's
code. David had the boundary term of the action incorrectly calculated
(some very minor errors). These have been fixed.

CHANGES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
June 24th, 2012 -- Bug-fixed David's code so that it runs. Fixed action.
     	   	   Did not add necessary data structures for full update. 
		   This was just a test.

June 25th, 2012 -- Renamed David's program 2p1-fixed-boundaries-old
     	   	-- Created a copy of Rajesh's 2p1 code as 
		   2p1-fixed-boundaries and replaced Rajesh's 
		   initialization.lisp with David's.
		

June 26th, 2012 -- Ported correct action with boundary-condition terms to 
		   2p1-fixed-boundaries code.
		-- Ported b-vector from David's old code to new
		   2p1-fixed-boundaries.

TODO ------------  Moves are not yet rejected if they attempt to change
     		   boundary. I need to figure out how this works. New action
		   is not yet read out in metropolis algorithm.

June 27th, 2012 -- Updated David's simplex counting functions to take
     	   	   advantage of Rajesh's new simplex data structures.
		   These are required for David's initialization.lisp
		   file to work.

TODO ------------- Make sure David's initialization.lisp makes calls
     		   to functions that all exist. This is nontrivial.
