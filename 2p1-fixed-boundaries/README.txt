IDEAS TO TEST:
1) Test the phase structure of fixed oboundaries.
--- Can we reproduce phase A?
--- Reproduce entire phase diagram? (hold on this)
--- At T028, increase k0 to about 4 and use k3(k0) to get ke. Do we get Phase A?

2) Fix volume and change the number of time slices. Just de Sitter-like phase. See what optimal fit is.

3) Compare fit with 64 time slices to fit with 28. Also compare fixed to periodic.

3.5) Does the de Sitter length change depending on stalk size?

4) Change in un-normalized probability amplitude as we perturb away from critical number of time slices?

5) LOW PRIORITY: change the area of the boundary?
